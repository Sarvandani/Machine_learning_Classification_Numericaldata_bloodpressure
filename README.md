# Machine_learning_Numericaldata_bloodpressure
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using numerical health metrics (e.g., Age, Cholesterol, BMI, Blood Sugar) to predict the presence or absence of High Blood Pressure (Hypertension).

It compares three different algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Finally, it selects the best-performing model and allows interactive user predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Features Used for Prediction
Feature	Description	Typical Range
Age	Patient's age (in years)	20 - 80
Cholesterol	Total cholesterol level (mg/dL)	150 - 300
BMI	Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²)	18 - 40
Blood Sugar	Blood sugar level (mg/dL)	70 - 150

ðŸ§  ML Models Used

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

The code automatically trains, evaluates, and compares these models.
It selects the best model based on test accuracy.
